# Intro
This page include a list of game that can be made using [pyTermTk](https://github.com/ceccopierangiolieugenio/pyTermTk).

## Features
Full mouse support and key presses, full glyphs set available on a standard terminal, plus NerdFonts and emoji if required

## Limitation
Any game cannot take advantage of the keyboard events up/down
For this reason games like MarioBros are not technically possible on a terminal where the release of the key is required for the interaztion
