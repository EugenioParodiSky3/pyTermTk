# root
#   The root (TTk) widget is the main element of any pyTermTk apps
#   It is responsible of any terminal routine, the terminal update
#   and the events forwarded to any child widgets
#
# root initialization params used:
#
#   layout = GridLayout
#     I am using a grid layout in order to align/resize the table
#     to the root widget (the terminal area)
#
#   mouseTrack = True (optional)
#     I am enabling the mouseTrack because the table can handle
#     the mouse move events and highlight the cells under the cursor

root = ttk.TTk(layout=ttk.TTkGridLayout(), mouseTrack=True)

# The TTkTable is the widget responsible of handling and displaying a table model
# There are several table models available, in this example I am using
# TTkTableModelList which require a simple 2d List with the table data

# I am initializing a simple list where any cell is a string representing its position (row,col) inside the list
dataList = [[f"{(row,col)}" for col in range(10)] for row in range(101)]
basicTableModel = ttk.TTkTableModelList(data=dataList)

# I am using as a style for the table a cell color with a
# TTkColor Dark Blue ("#000066") + a modifier which alternate the color with a standard BG_BLUE (="#0000FF")
tableStyle = {'default': {'color': ttk.TTkColor.bg("#000066", modifier=ttk.TTkAlternateColor(alternateColor=ttk.TTkColor.BG_BLUE))} }

# Table initialization:
#   parent = root
#     In this example the root terminal (TTk) has this table as the only child
#     since it is using a gridlayout, the child will be resized to occupy the entire
#     area available
#
#   tableModel = basicTableModel
#     I guess this is self explainatory
#
#   addStyle
#     merge the new style with the default one
#     this mergge is required to keep the default object theming values
#     not explictly overridden  (i.e. header/separators colors)
table = ttk.TTkTable(parent=root, tableModel=basicTableModel, addStyle=tableStyle)

# Adding a little touch, resizing the cols to its content
table.resizeColumnsToContents()

# Start the main thread
root.mainloop()
